# Oral Contraceptive Use and Perceived Weight

This repository currently contains additional results tables for a study on oral contraceptive use and perceived weight. When the manuscript is finalized for publication, we will add the R statistical code used in all analyses so that interested colleagues can reproduce our results and/or build on our work.
